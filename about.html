                    <p class="aboutlong">Hi there! My name is Mitchell and I'd like to thank you for 
                        visiting my website today. I created this website to demonstirate my web developing abilities, 
                        so I hope you enjoy it. I am a motivated software developer with experience in design
                        and architecture using C#, .NET, HTML & CSS, SQL, and Angular. I am also skilled in 
                        developing, optimizing, and reworking systems to meet specific requirements. Software 
                        engineering as a career field is actually something that was recommended to me by my 
                        cousin, who is a senior developer for Amazon. Soon after starting, I discovered that 
                        I loved Front End development becaue it alows me to use my creative side, as well as 
                        my constructive abilities. Thanks again for visiting.</p>
